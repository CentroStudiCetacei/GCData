GeoCetus is a volunteer-driven project launched in 2012 and developed by the <a href="http://centrostudicetacei.it" target="_blank">Centro Studi Cetacei</a>.
Its goal is to provide a <strong>georeferenced database of strandings</strong> and response activities involving cetaceans and sea turtles along the Italian coastline, together with a web portal for data access, consultation, and dissemination.

This repository provides direct access to the public datasets extracted from the GeoCetus database in open, machine-readable formats.

We believe that data should be treated as a shared resource: openly accessible data supports transparency, enables reuse, and fosters scientific research, environmental monitoring, and public awareness. Sharing data also enhances the value of the work invested in collecting, validating, and maintaining it.

The GeoCetus datasets are published as <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dati_aperti" target="_blank">open data</a> and distributed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/it/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> license.
